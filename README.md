### Hi there,

I am Adrian and I worked as a computer scientist / software engineer and partly also as a data engineer and full stack developer.
Here are some of my open GitHub repositories for people who like to have a look into my works.

From 2023 to 2024, I worked at Devoteam and created a **[Event Management platform in Python/Django](https://github.com/adibaba/django-events?tab=readme-ov-file#readme)** as a proof of concept.
I also became a *Certified Professional Python Programmer (PCPP1)* and got the [Python Institute certificate](https://verify.openedg.org/?id=bkLN.JUZr.VMOk).

From 2018 to 2023, I worked at the Data Science group at Paderborn University with a focus on Java and RDF.
I was a developer and later project manager in the *Open Data Portal Germany* project.
In the project, we transferred metadata records into 5-Star Linked Open Data.
I implemented and curated the majority of the **[OPAL Java repositories](https://github.com/projekt-opal/doc?tab=readme-ov-file#main-opal-repositories)**.
If you are more into text than code, take a look into the [OPAL project results](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03161.pdf) which are available in a 72-pages PDF file in German.
You can also check the final [OPAL presentation slides](https://projekt-opal.github.io/doc/final-presentation/Praesentation/) in HTML.

Later, I joined the project *Explainable machine learning for interactive episodic updates of models*.
We published an article and conducted experiments, which are available in the [Drift Detection repository (Jupyter notebooks)]([https://github.com/EML4U/Drift-detector-comparison](https://github.com/EML4U/Drift-detector-comparison#readme)).
I also explored possibilities for Drift Explanations via Polygons and Hyperboxes.
That is more in the direction shown in the **[data analysis presentation](https://eml4u.github.io/assets/img/EML4U_final_presentation.pdf)**. You can fetch some insights on the final presentation slides 5 to 8.

In between, I implemented some frontends and APIs.
I do not host them, but during writing this, some examples are still online.
I did the Website and [Embeddings.cc JavaScript API](https://embeddings.cc/api) for developers ([code](https://github.com/dice-group/embeddings.cc)) and the [LauNuts SPARQL query interface](https://adibaba.github.io/LauNuts/#sparql).
