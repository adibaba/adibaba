### Hey there,

I am **Adrian** and I worked as a **full-stack developer** (including requirements analysis), **computer scientist** and partly as a **data engineer** and **project manager**.
While my focus is on **Java** ‚òï and **Python** üêç in the backend, I am also interested in **web-technologies and frontend/UX** ‚ú®.
Here are some of my open GitHub repositories (marked with the corresponding symbols) and related works.

From 2023 to 2024, I worked at Devoteam, became a **Certified Professional Python Programmer (PCPP1)** and got the [Python Institute certificate (web)](https://verify.openedg.org/?id=bkLN.JUZr.VMOk).
I also created an [event management platform in Django üêç](https://github.com/adibaba/django-events?tab=readme-ov-file#readme) as a proof of concept.

From 2018 to 2023, I worked at the Data Science Group at Paderborn University with a focus on **Java** and Knowledge Graphs [ü§î](https://dice-research.org/news/2022-07-26_Learn-RDF/).
I was part of the developers team and later the **project manager** in the *Open Data Portal Germany (OPAL)* project.
In that project, we transferred and optimized open metadata records into 5-Star Linked Open Data [ü§î](https://5stardata.info/).
I implemented and curated the majority of the [OPAL repositories ‚òï](https://github.com/projekt-opal/doc?tab=readme-ov-file#main-opal-repositories).
If you are more into text than code, take a look into the [OPAL project results (PDF)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03161.pdf) which are available in a 72-pages document in German.
You can also check the final [OPAL presentation slides (web)](https://projekt-opal.github.io/doc/final-presentation/Praesentation/), also in German.
For ressources partly in English, take a look at the [OPAL deliverables (web)](https://github.com/projekt-opal/doc/tree/master/deliverables).

Later, I joined the project ***Explainable Machine Learning** for interactive episodic updates of models (EML4U)*.
We published an article and conducted experiments, which are available in the [drift detection repository (Jupyter notebooks) üêç](https://github.com/EML4U/Drift-detector-comparison#readme).
I also explored possibilities for drift explanations via semantic similarity in embeddings using polygons and hyperboxes.
That is more in the direction of **data analysis** and shown in the [EML4U presentation (PDF)](https://eml4u.github.io/assets/img/EML4U_final_presentation.pdf), where ou can fetch some insights on slides 5 to 8.

In between, I implemented some frontends and APIs using **JavaScript**.
I do not host them, but during writing this, some examples are still online.
I did the Website and the **[embeddings.cc API ‚ú®](https://github.com/dice-group/embeddings.cc)** for developers ([demo](https://embeddings.cc/api)) and the **[LauNuts SPARQL query interface ‚ú®](https://github.com/adibaba/LauNuts/tree/github.io)** ([demo](https://adibaba.github.io/LauNuts/#sparql)), which is integrated in hosting at GitHub.
The embeddings.cc virtual machine was configured by me and uses Elasticsearch in the backend.
I also got **DevOps** skills during the work with various systems, e.g. Docker.
A minimal (and nowadays outdated) example is the pre-configuration of an online programming exercises system for our students at [Java Online Exercises Docker repository](https://github.com/dice-group/JavaOnlineExercises).

From 2015 to 2017, I took a break from coding and focused on **requirements analysis** for a mobile app in the apprenticeship in the field of mechanical engineering.
There is no code repository, but this field of work is highly relevant for customer projects and their individual requirements.
There is a presentation regarding [media competeny](https://adibaba.github.io/MLS/Workshop-1/Praesentation) for trainers in mechanical engineering and a [presentation of the mobile application](https://cs.uni-paderborn.de/fileadmin-eim/informatik/fg/ddi/Forschung/Projekte/MLS/MLS-Anwenderworkshop-2017.pdf).
You can also have a look at the Mobile Learning in Smart Factories [MLS project website](https://cs.uni-paderborn.de/ddi/forschungsprojekte/abgeschlossene-projekte/mls) at the Computer Education Group at Paderborn University.

In 2014, I worked as a project engineer at RapidMiner.
In this period, a had a focus on **Java** and worked on a multi-repository-copy-feature, GUI, XML parsing and i18n.
I collected the [Java files in RapidMiner Studio](https://adibaba.github.io/rapidminer-studio/) with contributions from my side.

I finished my Computer Science studies in 2014.
In my master's thesis 2013, I developed a system for distributed computation of biliometrics on big data using **Java** and Hadoop
([PDF](https://digital.ub.uni-paderborn.de/download/pdf/2424565.pdf))
([DOI](https://doi.org/10.17619/UNIPB/1-88)).
In my bachelor's thesis 2010, I implemented a system for analysis and integration of data into a system data networks using **Java** and Equinox/OSGi/RDF.
([PDF](https://digital.ub.uni-paderborn.de/download/pdf/2424552.pdf))
([DOI](https://doi.org/10.17619/UNIPB/1-87)).
