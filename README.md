### Hi there,

I am Adrian and I worked as a computer scientist & software engineer and partly also as a data engineer & full stack developer.
Here are some of my open GitHub repositories for people who like to have a look into my works.

From 2023 to 2024, I worked at Devoteam and created a **[Event Management platform in Python/Django](https://github.com/adibaba/django-events?tab=readme-ov-file#readme)** as a proof of concept.
I also became a *Certified Professional Python Programmer (PCPP1)* and got the [Python Institute certificate](https://verify.openedg.org/?id=bkLN.JUZr.VMOk).

From 2018 to 2023, I worked at the Data Science group at Paderborn University with a focus on Java and RDF.
I was a developer and later project manager in the *Open Data Portal Germany* project.
In the project, we transferred metadata records into 5-Star Linked Open Data.
I implemented and curated the majority of the **[OPAL Java repositories](https://github.com/projekt-opal/doc?tab=readme-ov-file#main-opal-repositories)**.
If you are more into text than code, take a look into the [OPAL project results](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03161.pdf) which are available in a 72-pages PDF file in German.
You can also check the final [OPAL presentation slides](https://projekt-opal.github.io/doc/final-presentation/Praesentation/) in HTML.

Later, I joined the project *Explainable machine learning for interactive episodic updates of models*.
We published an article and conducted experiments, which are available in the [Drift Detection repository (Jupyter notebooks)](https://github.com/EML4U/Drift-detector-comparison#readme).
I also explored possibilities for Drift Explanations via Polygons and Hyperboxes.
That is more in the direction shown in the [data analysis presentation](https://eml4u.github.io/assets/img/EML4U_final_presentation.pdf). You can fetch some insights on the final presentation slides 5 to 8.

In between, I implemented some frontends and APIs.
I do not host them, but during writing this, some examples are still online.
I did the Website and **[embeddings.cc JavaScript API](https://embeddings.cc/api)** for developers ([code](https://github.com/dice-group/embeddings.cc)) and the **[LauNuts SPARQL query JavaScript interface](https://adibaba.github.io/LauNuts/#sparql)** ([code](https://github.com/adibaba/LauNuts/tree/github.io)), which is integrated in hosting at GitHub.
The embeddings.cc virtual machine was configured by me and uses Elasticsearch in the backend.
I also got **DevOps** skills during the work with various systems, e.g. Docker.
A minimal (and nowadays outdated) example is the pre-configuration of an online programming exercises system for our students at [Java Online Exercises Docker repository](https://github.com/dice-group/JavaOnlineExercises).

From 2015 to 2017, I took a break from coding and focused on **requirements analysis** for a mobile app in the apprenticeship in the field of mechanical engineering.
There is no code repository, but this field of work is highly relevant for customer projects and their individual requirements.
There is a presentation regarding [media competeny](https://adibaba.github.io/MLS/Workshop-1/Praesentation) for trainers and a [product presentation](https://cs.uni-paderborn.de/fileadmin-eim/informatik/fg/ddi/Forschung/Projekte/MLS/MLS-Anwenderworkshop-2017.pdf).
You can also have a look at the Mobile Learning in Smart Factories [MLS project website](https://cs.uni-paderborn.de/ddi/forschungsprojekte/abgeschlossene-projekte/mls) at the Computer Education Group at Paderborn University.

In 2014, I worked as a project engineer at RapidMiner.
In this period, a had a focus on **Java** and worked on a multi-repository-copy-feature, GUI, XML parsing and i18n.
I collected the [Java files in RapidMiner Studio](https://adibaba.github.io/rapidminer-studio/) with contributions from my side.

I finished my Computer Science studies in 2014.
In my master's thesis 2013, I developed a system for distributed computation of biliometrics on big data using **Java** and Hadoop
([PDF](https://digital.ub.uni-paderborn.de/download/pdf/2424565.pdf))
([DOI](https://doi.org/10.17619/UNIPB/1-88)).
In my bachelor's thesis 2010, I implemented a system for analysis and integration of data into a system data networks using **Java** and Equinox/OSGi/RDF.
([PDF](https://digital.ub.uni-paderborn.de/download/pdf/2424552.pdf))
([DOI](https://doi.org/10.17619/UNIPB/1-87)).
